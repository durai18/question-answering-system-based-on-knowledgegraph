# question-answering-system-based-on-knowledgegraph
Welcome to the Question Answering System based on Knowledge Graph repository! This project aims to develop an intelligent system that can answer natural language questions by leveraging a knowledge graph.

# Project Overview
The Question Answering System is built using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and graph-based algorithms. It utilizes a knowledge graph, which is a structured representation of information, to store and organize the knowledge needed for answering questions.

The system takes a question as input and processes it to understand the user's intent. It then uses the knowledge graph to extract relevant information and generate a concise and accurate answer. The knowledge graph is designed to represent entities, relationships, and attributes in a domain-specific context.

# Features
Question Processing: The system employs NLP techniques to parse and understand user questions, including entity recognition, intent detection, and query generation.

Knowledge Graph Construction: The knowledge graph is constructed by extracting information from structured and unstructured data sources. It captures the relationships and dependencies between entities.

Answer Generation: By querying the knowledge graph, the system generates answers based on the information retrieved. The answers are presented in a human-readable format.

Scalability: The system is designed to handle large knowledge graphs efficiently, allowing for scalability as the size of the knowledge base increases.

# Getting Started
To get started with the Question Answering System, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/question-answering-system.git
Install the necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the system: Update the configuration files to specify the data sources and settings for the knowledge graph construction.
Build the knowledge graph: Run the necessary scripts or processes to extract and load data into the knowledge graph.
Run the system: Execute the main script or start the server to interact with the Question Answering System.
